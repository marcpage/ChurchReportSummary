# ChurchReportSummary
TamperMonkey script to create a summary of the custom reports from "Create Report" function of the Leader and Clerk Resource area.

Note that often after loading a report or changing a report, TamperMonkey will not run the script. You can reload the page to force the tables to generate.

**How to use**

Install the browser plugin TamperMonkey. Open the TamperMonkey Dashboard and go to the Utilities tab. In the Install from URL section, paste in:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcpage/ChurchReportSummary/main/ChurchReportSummary.js

And then click the Install button.

Log into https://ChurchOfJesusChrist.org/ and go to the Leader and Clerk Resources under My Account and Ward.

Under Reports go to Create a Report. Select an existing report or create a new report. When the report is shown, if a table does not appear after the report, then refresh the page.
